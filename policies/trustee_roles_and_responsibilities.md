## Code of Conduct for Trustees

1. **Selflessness:** Trustees of Farset Labs have a general duty to act in the best interest of the organisation and its membership as a whole. They should not do so in order to gain financial or material benefits for themselves, their family, their friends or the organisation they come from or represent if they are appointed from outside of FSL membership.

1. **Integrity:** Trustees of Farset Labs should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their role. As well as avoiding actual impropriety, they should avoid any appearance of improper behaviour or accepting gifts and hospitality that might reasonably be thought to influence their judgement.

1. **Accountability:** Trustees of Farset Labs have a duty to comply with the law on all occasions in accordance with the trust placed in them and in such a way as to preserve public confidence in the organisation. They are accountable for their decisions and actions to the members, public and funders. They must submit themselves to what scrutiny is appropriate to their role (e.g. declare conflicts of interest to the register).

1. **Honesty:** Trustees of Farset Labs have a duty to declare any interests relating to their trustee role and to take steps to resolve any conflicts that may arise, and where private interests of a trustee conflicts with their trustee duties, they must resolve this conflict in favour of the trustee role. They must make relevant declarations of interest in the different circumstances and roles they play both within and outside the organisation.

1. **Leadership:** Trustees of Farset Labs should promote and support the principles of leadership by example. There will be circumstances under which trustees will be working directly with volunteers, paid staff and paid members (e.g. FSL events). Guidelines for such working relationships must be clear to both volunteers, staff and trustees and, when these occasions arise, the Chair should be informed in advance.

1. **Conflicts of interest:** Any trustee of Farset Labs who has a [financial interest in a matter under discussion](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/managing-conflicts-of-interest-in-a-charity) should declare the nature of their interest and withdraw from the room unless they have a dispensation to speak. If a trustee has any interest in the matter under discussion which creates a real danger of bias (that is, the interest affects them or a member of their household more than others affected by the decision) they should declare the nature of the interest and withdraw from the room, unless they have a dispensation to speak. If a trustee has any other interest which does not create a real danger of bias, but which might reasonably cause others to think it could influence their decision, they should declare the nature of the interest, but may remain in the room / call, participate in the decision, and vote if they wish. If in any doubt about the application of these rules, they should consult with the Chair. Each trustee’s interests should be recorded in a written statement and listed in a register.
