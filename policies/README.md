# Policies

This section of the handbook is necessarily a little bit drier than the rest; 

These policies are the fixed, and sometimes, legal, policies, protections and procedures we have in place and that we have to follow to.

The policies should also largely be 'stand alone' documents, without too many cross-links to other sections of the handbook, as in some cases, these policies will be sent out independently to the rest of the handbook as part of funding proposals and other contractual obligations.
